# ONDA

**(Online News Diversity Analyser)**

It has two parts, the extractor/aggregator/analyser (this part, written in Python) and the PHP front-end which also generates diversity scores in real-time.

I created this project for my University dissertation at The University Of Sheffield, and while successful was not perfect and could almost certainly do with some improvements in style and in performance.

If you stumble across this I would be most interested to know what you make of it. I will try to update it a little with some comments at some point.
